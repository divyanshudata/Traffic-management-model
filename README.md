# Smart AI-based Traffic Management System
An intelligent traffic simulation built using the **SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)** framework to optimize vehicle flow and reduce congestion.

## 🚀 Overview
This project leverages AI algorithms to manage traffic signals and vehicle routing dynamically. By simulating real-world traffic scenarios, the system aims to minimize wait times and CO2 emissions.

## 🛠️ Features
* **Real-time Traffic Monitoring:** Tracks vehicle density at intersections.
* **AI Integration:** (Mention if you are using Reinforcement Learning or specific heuristics).
* **Visual Simulations:** Full 2D/3D visualization via SUMO-GUI.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Simulation:** SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)
* **Language:** Python (TraCI API)
* **Environment:** Windows (VS Code)

## 🚦 How to Run
1.  **Clone the Repo:**
    `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Traffic-AI-SUMO.git`
2.  **Install SUMO:** Ensure `SUMO_HOME` is set in your environment variables.
3.  **Run the Simulation:**
    `python main.py`
